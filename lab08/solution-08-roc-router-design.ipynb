By combining these capabilities, the platform seeks to foster safe, informed, and collaborative hiking experiences.\\\n",
    "The platform will be deployed as a cloud-based web and mobile application accessible to all stakeholders. The distribution strategy includes an app available on major mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, alongside a responsive web interface. It will require an internet connection for features like real-time tracking, notifications, and user authentication, though some offline capabilities, such as pre-downloaded hike information, will also be available.\\\n",
    "User authentication will be role-based, ensuring that only authorized users, such as verified hut workers and platform managers, can access sensitive or administrative features.\\\n",
    "Visitors are the primary users of the platform. They can browse a comprehensive list of hiking trails, filter them based on specific criteria such as difficulty, length, or starting point, and view detailed descriptions. To access advanced features like personalized recommendations, visitors can create user accounts by registering on the platform. Registered users can record their fitness parameters, enabling the system to suggest trails tailored to their capabilities.\\\n",
    "During a hike, visitors can record their progress by marking reference points and sharing their live location through a broadcasting URL. They can also initiate group activities by planning hikes, adding group members, and confirming group participation. The platform allows visitors to start, terminate, and track their hikes, with notifications for unfinished hikes or late group members to ensure safety and accountability.\\\n",
    "Local guides enrich the platform by contributing essential information. They can add detailed descriptions of hikes, parking facilities, and huts, ensuring hikers have accurate and comprehensive data. Local guides also link parking lots and huts to specific trails as starting or arrival points, enhancing the planning process.\\\n",

Managers can also broadcast weather alerts for specific areas, notifying all hikers in those regions through push notifications. This ensures that users stay informed about potentially hazardous conditions.\\\n",
    "The platform manager's role includes maintaining an organized and secure user system while facilitating collaboration between local guides, hut workers, and visitors.\\\n",
    "Hut workers are critical to the maintenance of up-to-date trail and accommodation information. After registering and being verified, hut workers can log into the platform to add or update information about their assigned huts, including uploading pictures and describing the facilities available. They can also monitor and report on the condition of nearby trails, ensuring hikers receive current information.\\\n",
