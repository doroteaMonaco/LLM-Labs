    "A railway company offers the possibility to people under 15 to travel free. The offer is dedicated to groups\n",

    "For being eligible to the offer, at least a member of the group must be at least 18 years old. If this condition\n",
    "applies, all the under 15 members of the group travel free, and the others pay the Base Price.\n",
    "The function computeFee receives as parameters basePrice (the price of the ticket), n_passengers (the\n",
    "number of passengers of the group), n_over18 (the number of passengers at least 18 old), n_under15 (the\n",
    "number of passengers under 15 years old). It gives as output the amount that the whole group has to spend. It\n",
